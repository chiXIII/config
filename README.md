Includes all the manual configuration I use for Vim so that I can have uniform settings on any machine.
This is public mostly just so that I don't have to log into my personal Github account to access it,
but feel free to look at it and copy parts that you like.
I doubt you'll want to actually install it, though, unless you *really* like the way I do things and also have no imagination of your own.
